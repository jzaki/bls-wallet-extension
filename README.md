# Consolidated into mono-repo, [bls-wallet](https://github.com/jzaki/bls-wallet/)

# Quill - easy, fast, and low-cost Ethereum transactions
## Overview
Interaction with web3 applications can be slow, costly, and risky.
**Quill** leverages BLS signature aggregation on Ethereum layer 2 solutions, easily bringing fast and low-cost Ethereum transactions to your browser.
### Additional Benefits
* send multiple txs as one to ensure atomic execution
* pay even less gas by reducing on chain footprint of signatures

### How to use it
1. install the plugin
2. create a contract wallet (uses bls keys)
3. transfer L2 erc20 tokens
4. use contract wallet with L2 dapps (coming soon)

## Feature Summary
### MVP (uses Optimism)
* Chrome/Brave plugin
* Secure storage of BLS private-keys
* Sign tx data:
    * wallet creation
    * erc20 transfers
* Submit txs to hosted [aggregator](https://github.com/jzaki/bls-wallet-aggregator)
* Basic feedback from aggregator for UI updates (tx received, tx mined. tx dropped?)

### Upcoming
* Secure storage of EDDSA and ECDSA keys
* Social recovery
    * nominate guardians
    * recover contract wallet
* Receive tx data from existing L2 dapps on networks:
    * Optimism
    * Arbitrum (coming soon)
    * ...
* Receive and review multiple txs from dapps
    * sign all and submit to aggregator
* Wallet feedback (from L2 sequencer)
    * listening to wallet events
    * wallet tx history

### Future
* Sign and submit multiple transactions as one (to L2 sequencer)
    * local signature aggregation
* Review and sign typed data (712)

## Requirements
### Secure storage
* Safe storage options for extension

### BLS components
* signing transactions
* signature verification
* signature aggregation

### Servers
* Aggregator
* Future: L2 Sequencer

### User Interface Base
* Extension for Chrome/Brave and Firefox
    * Web Extensions? combined extensions standard
* [storyboard](https://drive.protonmail.com/urls/J7EECNCGS0#2xqYOqlIzeaB)
* Common:
    * Network name (hover chainId)
    * Current BLS Key (option to create)
    * Associated contract wallet address if any (option to create)
    * contract wallet balance (L2 ETH token)
    * Action to Transfer (starts tx data)
* tx edit section:
    * Method name "transfer" (show methodId)
    * Params as text fields
        * address with checks (length, checksum)
        * balance as decimal (*10^18)
* signed tx section:
    * signed txs per row
        * method name - nonce - (send)
    * (aggregate) - (send all)

## Development

Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local`, updating values as needed.

The 'local' in `.env.local` is your environment name. You need to supply this
to webpack by prefixing webpack-related commands with `ENV=local`.

To run the dev server:

```sh
ENV=local yarn run dev:chrome # or dev:firefox etc, see scripts in package.json
```
